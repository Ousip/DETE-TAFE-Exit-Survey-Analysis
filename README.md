# Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and Technical and Further Education (TAFE) Institute Exit Survey Analysis
In this project, we will be working with the exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment(DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) Institute in Queensland, Australia. The respective surveys can be found here and here.

The questions we will be focusing on in this project are:

- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to dissatisfaction towards work? What about the employees who have been with the organisation longer?
- Are younger employees resigning due to dissatisfaction? What about the older employees?
